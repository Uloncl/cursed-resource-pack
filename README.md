# cursed-resource-pack
This resource pack changes some in game sounds to clips of verious memes and other fun stuff.

I dont expect anyone to play with this on for very long but enjoy if you do choose to play with it heres some various things to try:
- visit a village
- attack an iron golem
- fly with an elytra with rockets
- ride in a minecart
- cook something in a furnace
- farm some mobs
- visit the nether
- fight the end dragon (in a new world)
- play the game

I will probably add more sounds in the future to other mobs and blocks
